    <p class="description"><cite><a href ="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/phishing-symptoms.aspx">Microsoft</a></cite>, explains that phishing is a kind of
      “social engineering attack” which consists of using deceiving emails to hoax victims into sharing sensitive
      information such as passwords, credit card details and
      other personal information. Those emails are often try to imitate an email from trusted companies to again the trust of
      the users that are being targeted. The main concept of this attack that instead of targeting the system, it’s the users
      using these systems are the targets. As seen in the <cite><a href="https://www.antiphishing.org/resources/apwg-reports/">Anti-Phishing Working Group</a></cite>, 2017 report the number of users
      targeted are very high with number as high as 51, 265 in March of 2017 for number of unique phishing websites detected.

    <p class="description2">This could include simply posting an accidental post or unknowingly clicking a phishing link.
      Tumblr also contains adult content or as known on tumblr ‘nsfw’ content which an user can accidently access if clicked on a wrong tag.

    <h1 class="title2">Prevention</h1>

    <p class="description2">Pay attention. Be careful with what you post and what you open. If you do open a link by accident and something unexpected started happening, run your anti-virus to check if a virus wasn’t downloaded onto your device. Tumblr also offers a set of settings that can help stay secure or block certain types of posts.
