      <p class="description">Users of email could encounter several malicious attacks on email including Spyware and Ransomware.</p>


      <p class="description">
        <cite><a href ="https://www.avast.com/c-spyware">Avast</a></cite>, explains that a
        spyware attack consist of eavesdropping and/or monitoring the users of the services
        and reports all the activity back to the source of the spyware. The aim of the spyware is to collect
        personal information such as passwords, Personal Identification
        Numbers, Social Security information, bank and credit accounts as well as other financial details.
        Those details are gained without consent as the software observers users behaviour to obtained the wanted information.
        Spyware is also able to change the function of the computer without the knowledge of the user and direct to unwanted
        webpages or overwhelm the users with a high amount pop-up ads.
        A scan done by <cite><a href ="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/">National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA)</a></cite>, 80% computers
        of 329 clienteles had some kind of spyware programs. It should be noted that each infected computer
        contained on average 93 spyware components.</p>

      <p class="description">
        <cite><a href ="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-ransomware-5-dos-and-donts.html">Norton</a></cite>, informs that
        Ransomware works on the basis that it targets your critical
        data and systems for the purpose of extortion. Ransomware is often linked with phishing
        emails which are also discussed on this page. The users get locked out of their system or data
        and are presented with a demand of a ransom payment. When the ransom is payed the user is
        supposedly meant to get access back to their data and system.

    <p class="description2"><cite><a href ="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/phishing-symptoms.aspx">Microsoft</a></cite>, explains that phishing is a kind of
      “social engineering attack” which consists of using deceiving emails to hoax victims into sharing sensitive
      information such as passwords, credit card details and
      other personal information. Those emails are often try to imitate an email from trusted companies to again the trust of
      the users that are being targeted. The main concept of this attack that instead of targeting the system, it’s the users
      using these systems are the targets. As seen in the <cite><a href="https://www.antiphishing.org/resources/apwg-reports/">Anti-Phishing Working Group</a></cite>, 2017 report the number of users
      targeted are very high with number as high as 51, 265 in March of 2017 for number of unique phishing websites detected.
