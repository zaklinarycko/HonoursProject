    <h1 class="title">Threats</h1>

    <p class="description">Users of unofficial movie webpages could encounter several malicious attacks including Spyware and Ransomware. Unofficial movie often do not host the content that the viewers are watching and therefore cannot be sure how secure this content is.  Even if the movie is just being streamed there is a possibility that something unwanted could have been downloaded.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      <cite><a href ="https://www.avast.com/c-spyware">Avast</a></cite>, explains that a
      spyware attack consist of eavesdropping and/or monitoring the users of the services
      and reports all the activity back to the source of the spyware. The aim of the spyware is to collect
      personal information such as passwords, Personal Identification
      Numbers, Social Security information, bank and credit accounts as well as other financial details.
      Those details are gained without consent as the software observers users behaviour to obtained the wanted information.
      Spyware is also able to change the function of the computer without the knowledge of the user and direct to unwanted
      webpages or overwhelm the users with a high amount pop-up ads.
      A scan done by <cite><a href ="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/">National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA)</a></cite>, 80% computers
      of 329 clienteles had some kind of spyware programs. It should be noted that each infected computer
      contained on average 93 spyware components.</p>

    <p class="description">
      <cite><a href ="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-ransomware-5-dos-and-donts.html">Norton</a></cite>, informs that
      Ransomware works on the basis that it targets your critical
      data and systems for the purpose of extortion. Ransomware is often linked with phishing
      emails which are also discussed on this page. The users get locked out of their system or data
      and are presented with a demand of a ransom payment. When the ransom is payed the user is
      supposedly meant to get access back to their data and system.

    <p class="description2">Many of those websites change their URLs rather often therefore there is many addresses for them –
      take Putlocker as an example.

    <p class="description2">Most of those websites do not work anymore but some fake addresses could pop up which
      have been set up by hackers and trick them to downloaded malicious software as described above.
      They might look and work like the “official” ones but no one is sure what goes on behind the scenes.

    <p class="description">
      pop-up adverts are common on those kind of websites as this is how they make their money. However, those can be annoying and unfortunately on occasion dangerous.
    </p>

    <p class="description">They can lead user to unwanted websites such as adults’ sites or simply ones that are not secure. Especially bad pop-ups are used to sell anti-viruses programs which are infect malware. Those pop-ups pretend to sell those programs as they detected a “virus” on the user’s PC and pretend to remove it after the user payed for it. Those are sometimes called “scareware”.
