    <p class="about">This page has been created for an honour project by a fourth year student in Robert Gordon University.
      Internet security is a vital aspect of the internet experience.
      It ensures that people are not victims to potentially dangerous attacks.
      The fast growth of the technology and the broadness of the web means that students could be exposed
      to vector attacks that they might not be aware that exist. This webpage aim is to help students be aware
      of the risks on the internet and learn how they can minimalise the risks of those threats.
